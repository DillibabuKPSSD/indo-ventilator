# Indo-Ventilator
An OpenSource Ventilator made with off-the-shelf components for the COVID-19 crisis. The components sourcing is immune to supply chain disruptions.
The aim is to facilitate a low cost and scalable manufacturing of ventilators with easily avaialable components and manpower.
Scalable (bulk) production could be done with minimal skilled workers, namely, a carpenter and an electrician.

# ❗️❗️**DISCLAIMER**
**PROJECT STATUS: We still need validation with health regulatory institutions and compliance with clinical requirements.**

⚠️ **WE DO NOT YET GUARANTEE THE OPERATION OF THIS MACHINE | THIS MACHINE IS FOR EMERGENCY and HEALTH SYSTEM COLLAPSE SCENARIOS**
